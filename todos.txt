[X] sperate movement from fps
[ ] controlable environement class
[ ] spawn food
[ ] neural network brain for doods
[ ] generation tracking
[ ] gene tracking
[ ] system for watching genes
[ ] observable avoidance behavior
[ ] observable food detection behavior
[ ] Handle collision detection between doods & doods
[ ] Handle collision detection between doods & food

Dood Specific:
[X] Collision detection for food
[ ] Collision detection for other doods
[ ] Breeding capabilities based on variables and collision
[ ] Fitness score
[ ] Scaling attributes, size, speed, perception
[ ] Color modulation based on attributes
[X] Collison Mask
[ ] Get their brain working and processing environment within 'sight'
 
Food specific:
[X] Class needs to be coded
[X] Needs stages with energy variants based on growth stage
[X] Growth based over delta time
[X] Collision mask

Environment Specifics:
[ ] Manage Start Variables, number of doods, number of food, max food, max doods, food spawn rate
[ ] Spawn Food - currently on initial environment creation, need interval spawning
[X] Contain Doods
[ ] Size variables
[ ] Contain entities in future builds, ie rocks and stuff.

Collisions arent working properly,
something to do with positions when created, offset is too much
